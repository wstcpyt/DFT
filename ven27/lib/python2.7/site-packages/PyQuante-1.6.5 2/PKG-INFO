Description: PyQuante is an open-source suite of programs for developing quantum
        chemistry methods. The program is written in the Python programming
        language, and has many 'rate-determining' modules also written in C
        for speed. The resulting code is not nearly as fast as Jaguar,
        Gaussian, or GAMESS, but the resulting code is much easier to
        understand and modify. The goal of this software is not necessarily to
        provide a working quantum chemistry program (although it will
        hopefully do that), but rather to provide a well-engineered set of
        tools so that scientists can construct their own quantum chemistry
        programs without going through the tedium of having to write every
        low-level routine. More information, including links to the download
        page, is available at http://pyquante.sourceforge.net.
